        <h3>Early years</h3>
        <p>Father, Hermann Einstein ( 1847 - 1902 ), was at that time a co-owner of a small business for the production of feather stuffing for mattresses and featherbeds. Mother, Pauline Einstein (née Koch, 1858 - 1920 ), came from the family of a wealthy corn merchant Julius Derzbacher (in 1842 he changed his last name to Koch) and Jetta Bernheimer.
      
      In the summer of 1880, the family moved to Munich , where Hermann Einstein, together with his brother Jacob, founded a small electrical equipment trading company. Albert's younger sister Maria (Maya, 1881 - 1951 ) was born in Munich .
      
      Albert Einstein received his primary education at a local Catholic school. According to his own recollections, as a child, he experienced a state of deep religiosity, which ended at the age of 12. Through reading popular science books, he came to the conviction that much of what is stated in the Bible cannot be true, and the state is deliberately engaged in deceiving the younger generation. All this made him a freethinker and forever gave rise to a skeptical attitude towards authorities. From childhood impressions, Einstein later recalled as the most powerful: the compass , Euclid's " Principles " and (about 1889 ) " Critique of Pure Reason» Immanuel Kant . In addition, at the initiative of his mother, he began playing the violin at the age of six. Einstein's passion for music continued throughout his life. While already in the United States in Princeton , in 1934, Albert Einstein gave a charity concert, where he performed the works of Mozart on the violin for the benefit of scientists and cultural figures who had emigrated from Nazi Germany .</p>
        <h3>The beginning of scientific activity</h3>
        <p>In 1900, Einstein graduated from the Polytechnic with a diploma in mathematics and physics. He passed the exams successfully, but not brilliantly. Many professors highly appreciated the abilities of Einstein's student, but no one wanted to help him continue his scientific career. Einstein himself later recalled. Although the next year, 1901 , Einstein received Swiss citizenship, until the spring of 1902 he could not find a permanent job - not even a school teacher. Due to the lack of earnings, he literally starved, not eating for several days in a row. This became the cause of liver disease , from which the scientist suffered until the end of his life.</p>
        <h3>Quantum theory</h3>
        <p>To solve the problem that went down in history under the name " Ultraviolet catastrophe ", and the corresponding agreement between theory and experiment, Max Planck suggested ( 1900 ) that the emission of light by matter occurs discretely (indivisible portions), and the energy of the emitted portion depends on the frequency of light. For some time, even its author himself regarded this hypothesis as a conditional mathematical device, but Einstein, in the second of the above-mentioned articles, proposed a far-reaching generalization of it and successfully applied it to explain the properties of the photoelectric effect . Einstein put forward the thesis that not only radiation, but also the propagation and absorption of light are discrete; later these portions ( quanta ) were calledphotons . This thesis allowed him to explain two mysteries of the photoelectric effect: why the photocurrent did not arise at any frequency of light, but only starting from a certain threshold , depending only on the type of metal, and the energy and speed of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of light, but only on its frequency. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect corresponded with high accuracy to experimental data, which was later confirmed by the experiments of Millikan ( 1916 ).</p>
